# Discord_Monty_Python_Bot
A bot that will help you on your quest for the holy grail

Add [this bot](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=774527385843662858&scope=bot&permissions=97344) to your server! Monty uses a few special APIs and beautifulsoup 4 along with other applications to bring a great experience for all.

## How this got started

A friend of mine gave me the idea to name this bot Monty Python for the sole reason of that I wanted to make a discord bot in Python. This bot was written using discord.py which can be found [here.](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) The discord.py documentation will help you get started on making your own bot if you wanted.
